Intent: 

This patterns lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into separate hierarchiesâ€”abstraction 
and implementation which can be developed independently of each other

Applicability:
- Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.
- when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.
