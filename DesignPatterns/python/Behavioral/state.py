Intent

This pattern lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if object changed its class

Applicability:
- object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific 
  code changes frequently.
- class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.
- lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine
